# After Authentication System Implementation What I have Changed

## Overview
I've implemented a register system for the React application with the following features:

### âœ… What I Fixed:

1. **Clean Authentication Service** (`src/services/authService.js`)
   - Handle register function in authService.js file
   - Add e logout feature with pre-implemented function

2. **Add New Page** (`src/components/BeforeVerify.jsx`)
   - The situation after click on register button is now clear
   - Redirects to a new page if clicked on register button
   - Redirect on mail inbox feature

3. **Updated Context Provider** (`src/context/ContextProvider.jsx`)
   - Added a new register function for register
   - A new state for setting a dynamic mail on "OPEN MAIL" button
